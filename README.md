# CS170-8-Puzzle

## Design

## Challenges

One challenge I faced while coding this project is the fact that early on in the project, I hard-coded the number of rows of the puzzle to equal three. This decision made the code much longer and much less abstract than it could have been. Another challenge I faced was figuring out when Python is pass-by-reference or pass-by-value.
